Problem #1     Block System call : 






Problem #2 :  play with directory

 1 create a directory without name from command line
 2 create a directory with name "-okgoogle"
 
 1 mkdir " " : this will create a directory without name(by giving space bar in between "") as name and won't be visible in HOME folder in GUI form.
 2 directory whose name starts with - (eg -okgoogle) in bash,If we are try so bash will treat the name as command line argument and we will get the error as
 mkdir: invalid option -- 'o'
 so Prefix the directory name with a ./ to avoid having it interpreted as an option:
 mkdir ./-okgoogle
 Alternatively, insert the argument -- (two dashes), which causes all arguments following it to be interpreted as file names and not as options:
 mkdir -- -okgoogle
