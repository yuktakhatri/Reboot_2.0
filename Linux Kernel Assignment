Problem #1     Block System call : 






Problem #2 :  play with directory

 1 create a directory without name from command line
 2 create a directory with name "-okgoogle"
 
 1 mkdir " " : this will create a directory without name(by giving space bar in between "") as name and won't be visible in HOME folder in GUI form.
 2 directory whose name starts with - (eg -okgoogle) in bash,If we are try so bash will treat the name as command line argument and we will get the error as
 mkdir: invalid option -- 'o'
 so Prefix the directory name with a ./ to avoid having it interpreted as an option:
 mkdir ./-okgoogle
 Alternatively, insert the argument -- (two dashes), which causes all arguments following it to be interpreted as file names and not as options:
 mkdir -- -okgoogle


Problem #3 :  create a directory structure 
mkdir -p A/{B/{G/K/reboot.txt,H/J/reboot.txt},C/{I/J/L/reboot.txt},D/{F/L/reboot.txt,E/M/reboot.txt}}
tree A

Problem #4.  share and files and folder 


 create two users name jack and Jill  from command line
create all the data under home directory of each users 
login with jack user and create a file name  jack.txt using vim editor and write "hello jack"
from jack user also create two directories name jack1 & jack2 
now login from Jill user and create a file. Jill.txt using vim editor and write "hey jiil"
from Jill also create two directoires named jill1 & jill2 

Important :  swap these files and directories in between users  and to swap don't use root account.

1.Logged into root account then:
adduser jack
passwd jack
adduser jill
passwd jill

2.Logged into jack account:
chmod 0777 /home/jack
touch jack.txt
vim jack.txt
   -> press i to insert text
   -> type "hello jack"
   -> press esc then : then wq then enter
mkdir jack1 jack2

3.Logged into jill account:
chmod 0777 /home/jill
touch jill.txt
vim jill.txt
   -> press i to insert text
   -> type "heyy jill"
   -> press esc then : then wq then enter
 mkdir jill1 jill2
 
 4. cp -r /home/jack/jack.txt /home/jill/jill.txt  
    #-r is used because we are ommiting directory and copy them recursively
    cp -r /home/jack/jack1 /home/jill/jill1
    cp -r /home/jack/jack2 /home/jill/jill2
    
    su Jack
    cp -r /home/jill/jill.txt /home/jack/jack.txt
    cp -r /home/jill/jill1 /home/jack/jack1
    cp -r /home/jill/jill2 /home/jack/jack2
